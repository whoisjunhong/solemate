Ultralight support meets maximum cushioning in the Nike Flyknit Air Max Mens Running Shoe, featuring the most flexible Max Air unit yet and a woven one-piece Flyknit upper. The full-length Max Air unit offers the most flexibility to date while still delivering maximum cushioning for ultimate comfort on your run. Its tubular construction allows more air underfoot to encourage even transitions from heel strike through toe-off. The ultralight Flyknit upper contours to your foot for a comfortable, supportive fit. Made entirely of polyester yarn, the single-layer construction seamlessly integrates areas of high breathability, stretch and support where you need it most.
